You will need to have these installed on your local computer, but presumably you do already if you are adding code to your qmd files.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx <- c(5, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55)\ny <- c(5, 20, 14, 32, 22, 38)\nlm(x ~ y)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = x ~ y)\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)            y  \n      1.056        1.326  \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Modify the GitHub Action\n\nYou will need to change the GitHub Action in `.github/workflows` to install these and any needed packages in order for GitHub to be able to render your webpage. The GitHub Action install R since I used that in `code.qmd`. If you use Python or Julia instead, then you will need to update the GitHub Action to install those.\n\nIf getting the GitHub Action to work is too much hassle (and that definitely happens), you can alway render locally and publish to the `gh-pages` branch. If you do this, make sure to delete or rename the GitHub Action to something like\n```\nrender-and-publish.old_yml\n```\nso GitHub does not keep trying to run it. Nothing bad will happen if you don't do this, but if you are not using the action (because it keeps failing), then you don't need GitHub to run it.\n\n## Render locally and publish to gh-pages branch\n\nTo render locally and push up to the `gh-pages` branch, open a terminal window and then `cd` to the directory with the Quarto project. Type this in the terminal:\n```\nquarto render gh-pages\n```\n",
